# All questions based on LCS (longest common subsequence):

> question is to return size of the longest common subsequence

- largest common substring
- print LCS
- shortest common subsequence (SCS)
- print SCS
- min number of insertion and deletion (a->b)
- largest repeating subsequence
- length of largest subsequence of 'a' which is a substring in 'b'
- subsequence pattern matching
- count how many times 'a' appear as subsequence in 'b'
- largest palindromic subsequence
- largest palindromic substring
- count of palindromic substring
- min number of deletions on a string to make it a palindrome
- min number of insertions in a string to make it a palindrome

PS. "A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but NOT necessarily contiguous."

format of LCS:
- input  is two/one string(can convert to two strings)
- question revolves around shortest/longest subsequences/substrings/palindromes
- output is string or length
