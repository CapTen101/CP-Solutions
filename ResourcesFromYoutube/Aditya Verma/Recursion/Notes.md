Video#1: 3 steps to solve a recursion problem:

- Try to find a makeable decision. then take a decision. That decision only makes our input smaller n smaller.
- make a recursion tree according to the problem.
- code the question according to the decision tree(cakewalk).

Video#2: Recursion is everywhere. NEVER SKIP THIS TOPIC!

Video#3: Base condition - Hypothesis - Induction method (IBH Method)

- (Smallest valid input)Base condition is decided first and foremost which whill terminate the recursion.
- Hypothesis - Understand the working of the problem by checking for various type of inputs (n).
- Induction - actual expression for recursion is developed here! frorm the help of hypothesis and is completed through the help of base condition.
