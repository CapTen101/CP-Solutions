Video#1: 3 steps to solve a recursion problem:

- Try to find a makeable decision. then take a decision. That decision only makes our input smaller n smaller.
- make a recursion tree according to the problem.
- code the question according to the decision tree(cakewalk).

Video#2: Recursion is everywhere. DON'T SKIP IT!
