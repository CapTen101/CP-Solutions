- Subset Sum...done (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/)
- Equal Sum Partition (very similar to Subset Sum Problem)..done (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-problem-dp-18/)
- Count of Subset Sum...done (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-of-subsets-with-sum-equal-to-x/)
- Minimum subset Sum difference (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-a-set-into-two-subsets-such-that-the-difference-of-subset-sums-is-minimum/)
- Target Sum
- no. of subset with given difference

NOTE:: Recursive Knapsack can often lead to TLE for bigger inputs because of increasing number of resursive calls.
NOTE:: Recursive Knapsack with Memoization(Top-Down Approach) is capable of all test cases. Although it has been known to throw StackOverFlow error only in case of a single famous question "Scrambled String".
NOTE:: Knapsack with Tabulation(Bottom-Up Approach) is capable of all test cases. No Exceptions.
